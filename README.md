# Insurance claims and complaints
## What is insurance claim and why does it matter?
Insurance claims are made by the policyholder to an insurance company for financial compensation or coverage for a loss under the terms of an insurance policy. If an event occurs that causes loss to things such as property, illness, accident, or damage, the policyholder can file a claim to receive financial compensation from the insurance company. Insurance is crucial because it provides financial protection against unexpected losses. Without insurance, individuals and businesses might face financial hardships due to unexpected losses and risks. 


## Our data 
Our project is on the data set gathered from insurance claims in Texas. This data set is from texas.gov and gives out information such as the complaint type, complaint confirmation, and how it was resolved. The Texas Insurance Claims Dataset is a comprehensive repository of insurance claims filed within the state of Texas, providing valuable insights into the insurance landscape in this region. This data set encompasses a range of insurance types, including auto, home, health, and property insurance claims collected over a multi-year period. It contains detailed information about each claim, such as the claimant's demographic data, policy details, claim amount, claim date, and the cause of the claim, whether it be related to accidents, natural disasters, or other incidents. Additionally, the dataset includes geographical information, allowing for spatial analysis and regional comparisons, as Texas is known for its diverse climate and varying risk factors across different regions.

## Our goal
Our goal is to take note of and provide for relations between the different information gathered within our data set. Our hypothesis would include the relationships between the parties involved in the case, the reasoning behind the complaint, and the time to receive and close the cases. Our group would like to gain more information on the factors at play within insurance using the different data types as a guide. For example, one hypothesis we came up with was that the most frequent insurance claim was filed as a life, accident, or health claim. Using correlations, our group plans to find important conclusions within the insurance industry in Texas.

## Hypothesis 1
Insurance claim denial is the top reason for insurance complaints.

## Hypothesis 2
Education level has a negative correlation with fraud, with a lower likelihood of fraud being reported by individuals with higher levels of education. Individuals with a higher level of education likely have a better understanding of the consequences of committing insurance fraud and, thus, will avoid activities that could elicit fraud.

## Hypothesis 3
The availability of a police report has a negative correlation with fraud reporting. In other words, the presence of a police report means that it is less likely that fraud will be reported. A police report provides official documentation of the incident and thus will provide less of an opportunity for the individual to commit fraud.

## Hypothesis 4
The likelihood of insurance claim fraud is correlated with cases that have higher financial stakes. This is because committing fraud is a very serious risk, so there must be a reasonable financial payout for fraudsters to make the risks worthwhile. A way to determine the financial stakes is by looking at the severity of damage, as more damage will result in a higher insurance payout.
