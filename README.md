# Insurance_Claims
Our project is on the data set gathered from insurance claims in Texas. This data set is from texas.gov and gives out information such as the complaint type, complaint confirmation, and how it was resolved. The Texas Insurance Claims Dataset is a comprehensive repository of insurance claims filed within the state of Texas, providing valuable insights into the insurance landscape in this region. This dataset encompasses a range of insurance types, including auto, home, health, and property insurance claims collected over a multi-year period. It contains detailed information about each claim, such as the claimant's demographic data, policy details, claim amount, claim date, and the cause of the claim, whether it be related to accidents, natural disasters, or other incidents. Additionally, the dataset includes geographical information, allowing for spatial analysis and regional comparisons, as Texas is known for its diverse climate and varying risk factors across different regions.

Our goal is to take note of and provide for relations between the different information gathered within our dataset. Our hypothesis would include the relationships between the parties involved in the case, the reasoning behind the complaint itself, and the time taken to receive and close the cases. Our group would like to gain more information on the factors at play within insurance using the different data types as a guide. For example, one hypothesis we came up with was that the most frequent insurance claim was filed as a life, accident, or health claim. Using correlations, our group plans to find important conclusions within the insurance company in Texas.
